# TaskHub Project Architecture & Documentation

TaskHub is a cross-platform, offline-first desktop productivity application built using **C++ (Logic)**, **Qt 6 / QML (UI)**, **SQLite (Local Storage)**, and **Firebase REST APIs (Cloud Sync & Auth)**. It strictly follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Workflow Breakdown)

### 1. The Startup Flow (`main.cpp`)
When the application launches, `main.cpp` acts as the dependency injector:
1. It reads `firebase_config.json` to get the API Key and Project ID.
2. It initializes the **Services** (`LocalCacheService`, `TaskService`, `AuthService`, `FirestoreService`, `SyncService`).
3. It initializes the **ViewModels** (`TaskListViewModel`) and passes the `TaskService` into it.
4. It injects the `authService` and `taskListViewModel` directly into the QML Root Context.
5. Finally, it loads `Main.qml`.

### 2. The Authentication Flow (With Auto-Login)
1. On launch, `main.cpp` instructs `authService.autoLogin()`.
2. `AuthService` checks `QSettings` for a persistently saved `refreshToken`.
3. If found, it exchanges the refresh token with Google's Secure Token endpoint for a new `idToken`, avoiding repetitive logins.
4. If no token exists, `Main.qml` routes the user to `LoginScreen.qml`.
5. Upon successful login/signup, new tokens are saved to `QSettings`, and the dashboard is loaded.

### 3. The Offline-First Task Workflow (MVVM)
TaskHub uses an **Offline-First** approach. The UI always reads from and writes to the local SQLite database first to ensure zero latency.

- **Creating a Task (TickTick-style):**
  1. The user types a task in the `TaskList.qml` input field.
  2. Pressing **Enter** immediately adds the task to the local database and clears the input, allowing for rapid-fire task entry.
  3. QML calls `taskListViewModel.addTask(title, "")`.
  4. The ViewModel passes this to `TaskService::createTask()`.
  5. `TaskService` asks `LocalCacheService` to execute an `INSERT` into the SQLite database.
  6. If successful, `TaskService` emits `tasksChanged()`.
  7. The `TaskListViewModel` catches this signal, reloads the tasks, and updates the UI.

- **Visual Priority & Tagging:**
  1. `TaskItem.qml` uses priority-based colors for completion checkboxes (e.g., Red for High, Blue for Normal).
  2. Tags are displayed with hash-based color accent bars for easy visual categorization.
  3. The "Add Task" popup features a multi-select dropdown for tags, pulling from existing tag data.

- **Grouping and Sorting (Phase 1):**
  1. During `loadTasks()`, the C++ ViewModel automatically computes a string category for each task based on its DB state: "Pinned", "Overdue", "Today", "Upcoming", "No Date", or "Completed".
  2. The ViewModel sorts the tasks strictly by Category Order → Priority → Due Date → OrderIndex.
  3. QML's `ListView.section.property` utilizes this pre-sorted sequence to effortlessly render dynamic sticky headers with collapsible arrow icons.

- **Inline Actions (Phase 2):**
  1. Tasks can be renamed via native QML `TextField`s. Hitting Enter immediately commits the update to C++.
  2. Clicking the trash icon triggers `softDeleteTask`, which sets `status="trashed"` in SQLite. `LocalCacheService` automatically filters these out of future queries.

### 4. Search and Filter System (Phase 3 & 4)
- **Local Filtering**: Users can filter tasks by clicking "Tags" or predefined dates ("Today", "Inbox") in the Sidebar. The C++ ViewModel performs in-memory filtering.
- **Native Search**: A top search bar is bound to the ViewModel. As the user types (with a 300ms UI debounce), `LocalCacheService` executes raw SQLite `LIKE` queries (`title LIKE %search% OR description LIKE %search%`) for blazing fast performance on massive datasets.

### 5. Specialized Productivity Views (Phase 6, 7 & 8)
- **Calendar View**: An agenda-style view that groups tasks by due date, allowing users to visualize their schedule.
- **Eisenhower Matrix**: A decision-making tool that categorizes tasks into four quadrants: *Urgent/Important*, *Not Urgent/Important*, *Urgent/Not Important*, and *Not Urgent/Not Important*.
- **Habit Tracker**: A dedicated view for tracking recurring habits and streaks.
- **Pomodoro Timer**: A focus tool with customizable work and break intervals to boost productivity.
- **Search View**: A global search interface that utilizes SQLite's Full-Text Search capabilities.

### 6. Interactive Popups & Modals
- **Add List Popup**: Defined within `Sidebar.qml`, this modal allows users to create new lists with custom colors and folder nesting. It uses a proper dimming overlay to maintain focus.
- **Add Tag Popup**: Also in `Sidebar.qml`, it enables quick creation of tags with color selection.
- **Account & Notifications**: Lightweight popups for user profile management and app alerts.

### 7. Background Cloud Synchronization (`SyncService` Phase 5)
To keep data backed up without blocking the UI, the `SyncService` acts as a background manager.
1. `LocalCacheService` maintains an `isDirty` schema. Any local edit flips `isDirty = 1`.
2. Every 5 minutes, `SyncService` wakes up and queries `getDirtyTasks()`.
3. **Batch Sync Up:** It wraps all dirty tasks into a single Google REST API `:commit` batch payload and fires it. Upon success, it clears the local dirty flags.
4. **Paginated Sync Down:** It pulls remote tasks from Firestore, utilizing `nextPageToken` loops.
5. **Conflict Resolution:** During sync-down, it enforces "Local Wins if Newer". If a remote task is pulled, it only overwrites the local SQLite row if `remoteTask.updatedAt > localTask.updatedAt` AND the local task is not marked dirty.

### 8. The Design System (`Theme.qml`)
Instead of hardcoding colors like `"#121212"` everywhere, we use a global singleton called `Theme.qml`.
If we ever want to change the app's primary color from Blue to Purple, or switch from Dark Mode to Light Mode, we only need to change the values inside `Theme.qml`, and the entire application will instantly update.
